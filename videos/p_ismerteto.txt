On July 26, the Republic of the Pigs was overthrown. Iron Tusk seized power. The people acknowledged the events with joy and euphoria. During his official celebratory address to the nation on August 1, Iron Tusk spoke the following words to his people:##“Why are there populations on this planet...who have more carrots than we do? Why is their land bigger and more productive...than our own? ’WHO GAVE THEM THE RIGHT!?’ I ask. Why shouldn’t we have carrot fields and corn fields too? If we do not become a productive country NOW, coming generations will find out what hunger is! Millions of pigs are working their hooves to the bone in our factories to earn their daily bread. How could I sleep at night if I didn't help them in their struggle? The republic of the exploiters has been ended once and for all! We are poised...at the gateway...to a brave new world!”##Soldier, as General Iron Tusk's favorite cousin, it will be your job to take a small troop and protect the vital army movements from any obstructions to their objectives. The general doesn't like disappointments...if you get my drift.
