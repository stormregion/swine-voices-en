On August 3rd, under the orders of General Iron Tusk, the NATIONAL ARMY OF PIGS crossed the border without warning and penetrated deep into Carrotland territory. In only two weeks, they burned everything to the ground, and blockaded the capital. As a result of the bitter fighting, the rabbit army is decimated. The towns and villages are deserted. The rabbits' determined defense has not been very successful in thwarting the aggressors, and their weakened army is unable to stop the hordes of swine. In desperation, the rabbit government and the rabbit High Command have reached the following decision: Because it will be impossible to defeat Iron Tuskâ€™s war machine with a frontal attack, they will need to resort to subterfuge. They will assemble a tough backup team from the remainders of the fighting reserves. This team will need to penetrate enemy lines, and be able to attack the enemy from behind, without suffering too many losses. The objective will be to cause the enemy to lose both their supply lines and their military support facilities. The rabbits are now looking for a good officer capable of executing this plan.
